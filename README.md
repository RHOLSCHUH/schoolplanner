Work in progress | 
main program code: main.py |
This application is still a work in progress. The end goal of this application is to make it easier for students to keep track of not only their assignments, but also their day-to-day tasks such as grocery shopping. It includes adding assignments, a list of the assignments listed in the order they are due. It also contains a class management tab where you can add your classes, what time/day they are. What I plan to add is a full calendar tab which shows what tasks or assignments are due on those days or what classes you have. The settings tab is also a work in progress still as well.
